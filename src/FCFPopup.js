          <h6>The Problem / Potential Users</h6>
          <p className="m-0">
            From our teammate Maddy‚Äôs experiences in journalism classes,
            internship experiences, and conversations with industry
            professionals, we learned that{" "}
            <strong>
              journalistic fact-checking for stories and articles is still
              taught and done in industry on paper
            </strong>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            This process involves following a complex set of steps, including:
            <br />
            <br /> <strong>01.</strong> Circling any word or phrase that could
            be spelled wrong or factually incorrect.
            <br /> <strong>02.</strong> Crossing out each letter in a word as
            it‚Äôs checked against a credible source.
            <br /> <strong>03.</strong> Tracking down any in-person sources to
            confirm that they‚Äôve been quoted correctly.
            <br />
            <br /> This becomes a huge pain when fact-checkers have to receive
            digital copies of stories, print them and fact-check them, then{" "}
            <strong>summarize their changes again digitally</strong> to send
            back to the writer/editor.

            <h6>Design Process</h6>
            We quickly decided that the ideal platform for our digitalized
            fact-checking was <strong>Google Docs</strong>; it‚Äôs highly
            accessible and used more commonly by smaller newsrooms, while larger
            publications often write their stories in custom-built content
            management systems (CMSs).
          </p>
          <p>
            To start testing our assumptions, we created a basic prototype on
            paper, and had users go through adding a fact, fixing a fact marked
            incorrect, and attributing a fact to a source.{" "}

            <h6>User Testing</h6>
            In testing our paper prototype with 2 journalism students who had
            learned to fact-check with the conventional method, we obtained
            three key insights from our first prototype:
            <br />
            <h4 className="m-bottom-0">
              Better utilize our available sidebar space.
            </h4>
            <p className="m-0">
              Both users were confused by the functionality of the buttons that
              were on the sidebar, and separately expressed their desire to be
              able to see all of the facts at once. We combined these
              observations as an opportunity to think differently about our
              "core display" and what should be apparent to users pretty much
              all the time when the plugin is running.
            </p>
            <h4 className="m-bottom-0">
              The filter system has to be reworked.
            </h4>
            <p className="m-0">
              One user felt that the filters seemed too specific to be useful,
              while the other simply felt that there were too many. The
              categories that we had came out of our inquiries into the most
              common types of facts that fact-checkers deal with, but these
              tests inspired us to think twice about them.
            </p>
            <h4 className="m-bottom-0">
              Highlights, icons, and font weight changes galore.
            </h4>
            <p className="m-0">
              Even in black and white, users felt like there was too much going
              on visually. They didn't always understand why these changes were
              occurring between screens and wanted a less invasive experience.

            After iterating on our initial ideas, we moved to higher-fidelity
            prototyping on Figma so that we could better visualize the product
            as it would appear on Google Docs. These are a few of the artefacts
            we produced:

            somewhat similar to that of Google Docs itself--this was done in
            hopes of increasing the apparent credibility of the tool and
            lowering the necessary cognitive load on the user.

          </p>
          <p>
            Our initial ideas for this project were complex and far-reaching; we
            daydreamed about fully-automated systems that could identify facts
            for you, find sources by searching Google for you, and store all of
            this information in an organization-wide knowledge base so it would
            only need to be checked once. While all of this would be amazing, we
            were lucky in the fact that we'd stumbled upon a problem area with
            little progress so far. This meant that we could already provide
            great value to the community by porting existing functionality into
            a clean online interface. This isn't to say that our dreaming big
            was for nothing; instead, it was a driving factor for us to nail the
            core functionality so that we could create a product that could be
            truly disruptive in this space.
