        This initial examination of the filter system on Airbnb led us to believe that<strong> lessening the fatigue and frustration that guests experience while searching would help them to successfully complete bookings more quickly.</strong></p>

        <div className="w-50 p-top-5 mobile-w-100">
        <p className="m-0">Much of the work for this project was done as a group; some of my individual responsibilites included running a <strong>survey</strong> on perceptions of Airbnb as a brand, investigating <strong>guest mental models</strong> with a <strong>card-sorting exercise</strong>, creating <strong>high-fidelity mockups in Figma</strong> for user testing, and being the primary <strong>visual designer</strong> for presentation materials.

        <p className="m-0 m-bottom-5"><em>Part of our survey results, showing wide variance in the types of amenities that guests expect
        from Airbnb (none of which are explicitly included by selecting "Private Room!").</em></p>
        <p>To better understand Airbnb guests, their preferences in search, and the assumptions they make while searching, we conducted a survey
        that we distributed among people in our personal networks who fall into Airbnb's core user base (older than college-age). </p>
        <p>Every person surveyed (n=55) had previously browsed listings on Airbnb, and guests tended to use a moderate amount of filters in their search.
        The pictured graph was definitely the most interesting part of our results: it suggested there was validity
        to our hypothesis that<strong> guests do not have a strong understanding of the meanings of the current filters on Airbnb.</strong></p>

        <img src="/img/cardsorting.jpg" width="150%" className="p-top-5"/>
        <p>Later in the process, we used a card-sorting exercise with some of the existing Airbnb filters to better understand how guests
        perceive the current filters. </p>
